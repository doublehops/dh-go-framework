This is a playground to see how to go about implementing many 
required features of a RESTful API using Gin.

The basic requirements from a RESTful API framework are:
- ~~parameters in URL - such as `api/user/123`~~
- ~~easy validation~~
- database integration
- database migrations
- pagination
- `includes` parameter to include related models in response. 
- ability to include prebuilt and custom middleware
- easy filtering in URLs
- CRUD scaffolding
- ci/cd
- documentation

Good to have:
- command line tool to list endpoints
